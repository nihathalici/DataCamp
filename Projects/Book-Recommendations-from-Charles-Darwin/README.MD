If you haven't heard of Game of Thrones, then you must be really good at hiding. Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books.
This dataset constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the edges between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge. Let's start by loading in the data for the first book A Game of Thrones and inspect it.
